# Your analysis should look similar to the following:

#   ```text
#   Financial Analysis
#   ----------------------------
#   Total Months: 86
#   Total: $22564198
#   Average Change: $-8311.11
#   Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
#   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
#   ```

# In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
